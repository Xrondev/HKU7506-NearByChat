## ‚ö†Ô∏èImportant Notes

- **GMS service is required**, Huawei devices are not supported.
- **For testing the app: Android Virtual Devices (AVDs)** may not work properly: it could discover
  the virtual devices but cannot establish a connection, seems the AVDs cannot emulate a proper
  bluetooth connection. *You should use physical devices to test the app if AVDs are not working.*
- This app is only tested on Android 14 devices, you should check the permissions if it is not
  working on your device. Also, different ROM may have different behaviors on specific
  permissions `e.g. NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`.
- This app is not optimized for performance or code cleanliness, it is a course project for the
  Nearby Connections API.
- `file send` is implemented but not tested, it may not work properly, I do not have enough physical
  devices to test it now.
